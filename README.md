# Drupal 7 paystack buy me a coffee
It seems the adoption of drupal CMS in ecommerce is kinda poor here in Nigeria, as a Drupal evangelist always preaching and
 reconciling developers to drupal i have decided to start my open source series of drupal 7 modules first and then move to drupal 8.
 
 ## Features
 This is a simple module that allow sitebuilder to place a **donate button** on the website, so users can donate to their page, 
 it comes with four varieties of button to click


- Buy me coffee = #200
- Recharge my phone = #1,000
- Buy me dinner = #500
- Buy me pizza = #3,000
 
 
 This is a part one series, other drupal paystack module i will be working on include

 1. Commerce integration, was inspired by @Kendysond however this will be commerce version
 2. Simple payment form

 
 Made with love for the [drupal] (https://drupal.org) community
